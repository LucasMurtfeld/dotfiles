Since we have a set of targets, `what are a few ways to determine if the host is likely a Windows Machine`? To answer this question, we can look at a few things. The first one being the `Time To Live` (TTL) counter when utilizing ICMP to determine if the host is up. A typical response from a Windows host will either be 32 or 128. A response of or around 128 is the most common response you will see. This value may not always be exact, especially if you are not in the same layer three network as the target. We can utilize this value since most hosts will never be more than 20 hops away from your point of origin, so there is little chance of the TTL counter dropping into the acceptable values of another OS type. In the ping output `below`, we can see an example of this. For the example, we pinged a Windows 10 host and can see we have received replies with a TTL of 128.
