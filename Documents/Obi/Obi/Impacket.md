The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.
