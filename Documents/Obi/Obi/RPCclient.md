#### RPCclient

SMB

```shell-session
NivaLada@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

|**Query**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|

These examples show us what information can be leaked to anonymous users. Once an `anonymous` user has access to a network service, it only takes one mistake to give them too many permissions or too much visibility to put the entire network at significant risk.

Most importantly, anonymous access to such services can also lead to the discovery of other users, who can be attacked with brute-forcing in the most aggressive case. Humans are more error-prone than properly configured computer processes, and the lack of security awareness and laziness often leads to weak passwords that can be easily cracked. Let us see how we can enumerate users using the `rpcclient`.

#### Rpcclient - User Enumeration

SMB

```shell-session
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[mrb3n] rid:[0x3e8]
user:[cry0l1t3] rid:[0x3e9]


rpcclient $> queryuser 0x3e9

        User Name   :   cry0l1t3
        Full Name   :   cry0l1t3

rpcclient $> queryuser 0x3e8

        User Name   :   mrb3n
        Full Name   :
        Home Drive  :   \\devsmb\mrb3n
        Dir Drive   :

        unknown_2[0..31]...
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
        acb_info :      0x00000010
        fields_present: 0x00ffffff
        logon_divs:     168
        bad_password_count:     0x00000000
        logon_count:    0x00000000
        padding1[0..7]...
        logon_hrs[0..21]...
```

We can then use the results to identify the group's RID, which we can then use to retrieve information from the entire group.

#### Rpcclient - Group Information

SMB

```shell-session
rpcclient $> querygroup 0x201

        Group Name:     None
        Description:    Ordinary Users
        Group Attribute:7
        Num Members:2
```

However, it can also happen that not all commands are available to us, and we have certain restrictions based on the user. However, the query `queryuser <RID>` is mostly allowed based on the RID. So we can use the rpcclient to brute force the RIDs to get information. Because we may not know who has been assigned which RID, we know that we will get information about it as soon as we query an assigned RID. There are several ways and tools we can use for this. To stay with the tool, we can create a `For-loop` using `Bash` where we send a command to the service using rpcclient and filter out the results.

#### Brute Forcing User RIDs

SMB

```shell-session
NivaLada@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done

        User Name   :   sambauser
        user_rid :      0x1f5
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   mrb3n
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   cry0l1t3
        user_rid :      0x3e9
        group_rid:      0x201
```

An alternative to this would be a Python script from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) called [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).
